# 📝 CodeTrack — A Simple React Todo App

CodeTrack is a lightweight, modern Todo application built using **React** and **Vite**, with global state managed through the **Context API** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks with a clean and responsive interface. Todos are persisted using **localStorage**, so your data stays even after a page refresh.
